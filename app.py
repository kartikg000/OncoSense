This application uses a trained Machine Learning model (a **Random Forest Classifier**) 
to predict whether a breast mass is **Benign** (non-cancerous) or **Malignant** (cancerous), 
based on 10 key physical measurements of the cell nuclei.

### Project Flow:
1.  **Data Collection:** Used the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) Dataset.
2.  **Preprocessing:** Feature scaling was performed using `StandardScaler`.
3.  **Model Training:** A **Random Forest Classifier** was trained on the 10 'mean' features.
4.  **Deployment:** The trained model and scaler are loaded into this Streamlit application.

### Navigate:
-   **üìä Data Exploration:** View the raw dataset, feature statistics, and visualizations.
-   **üîÆ Prediction:** Input 10 cellular measurements using sliders to get a real-time diagnosis prediction.
-   **üß† Model Explained:** Understand the mathematics behind **Standard Scaling** and the **Random Forest** algorithm, including which features were most important.
